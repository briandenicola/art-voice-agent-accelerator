## [2.0.0-beta] - 2025-12-19

### 🎉 Beta Release: Unified Agent & Scenario Framework

Beta release featuring the **YAML-driven agent system**, **multi-scenario orchestration**, and **Azure VoiceLive SDK** integration. This release represents a complete architectural evolution from v1.x.

### Added

- **Unified Agent Framework** — YAML-driven agent definitions (`agent.yaml`) with Jinja2 prompt templating and hot-reload
- **Scenario Orchestration** — Multi-agent scenarios with `orchestration.yaml` defining agent graphs, handoffs, and routing
- **Azure VoiceLive SDK** — Native integration with `gpt-4o-realtime` for ~200ms voice-to-voice latency
- **Industry Scenarios** — Banking (concierge, fraud, investment) and Insurance (FNOL, policy advisor, auth) ready-to-use
- **15+ Business Tools** — Authentication, fraud detection, knowledge search, account lookup, card recommendations
- **Streaming Mode Selector** — Frontend toggle between SpeechCascade and VoiceLive orchestrators
- **Profile Details Panel** — Real-time caller context display with tool execution visualization
- **Demo Scenarios Widget** — One-click scenario switching for demos and testing

### Enhanced

- **Package Management** — Migrated to `uv` for 10x faster installs with reproducible `uv.lock`
- **OpenTelemetry** — Full distributed tracing across LLM, Speech, and ACS with latency metrics
- **Phrase Biasing** — Dynamic per-agent phrase lists for improved domain-specific recognition
- **Agent Handoffs** — Seamless context preservation during multi-agent transfers
- **Devcontainer** — ARM64/x86 multi-arch support with optimized startup

### Fixed

- VoiceLive "already has active response" conflicts during rapid handoffs
- LLM streaming timeouts (now 90s overall, 5s per-chunk with graceful cancellation)
- Tool call index validation filtering malformed responses
- Docker build optimization removing unnecessary apt upgrades
